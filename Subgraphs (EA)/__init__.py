    9. Subgraphs (EA)
    Consider an undirected graph G(V , E) with 2n nodes ( V is the set of nodes, and
    E is the set of edges). Partitionate the set of nodes in two disjoint sets V 1 and V 2,
    each containing exactly n nodes, in such a way that between any two nodes of the subgraphs
    determined by the subsets of nodes should be a path (both subgraphs are conex).
